# bookEDeasy
### Problem statement:
People who have extra/used books find it challenging to handle them. They usually give it to scrapers which results as a wastage.
<br />
### Solution:
"bookEDeasy" is a website where you can donate those used books to any other person in need. And in return, you get points (1 book = 1 point) which can then be used to purchase other used books on our platform. Here, you can get educational books like NCERT, fictional and non-fictional books.
<br />
<br />
We make it easier for you to obtain the necessary education by establishing a feasible book exchange platform.
